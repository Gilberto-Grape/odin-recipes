    <p><strong><em>Shepherd's pie, cottage pie, or in French cuisine hachis Parmentier</em></strong>
        is a savoury dish of cooked minced meat topped with mashed potato and baked, also clled Sanders or Saunders. 
        The meat used may be either previously cooked or freshly minced. The usual meats are beef or lamb.</p>

        <p>The terms shepherd's pie and cottage pie have been used interchangeably since they came into use in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, although some writers insist that a shepherd's pie should contain lamb or mutton, and a cottage pie, beef.</p>
