    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>

       <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>1 pound refrigerated pizza dough</li>
            <li>¬º cup pizza sauce</li>
            <li>¬Ω cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
            <li>¬Ω cup sliced pepperoni</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>Steps</h2>

         <h4> 
          <ol>
              <li>Place a pizza stone on an outdoor grill directly over a wood fire. You may first need to spread out the wood if the flames are too high.</li>
              <li>Roll out pizza dough on a flat surface to desired thickness. Place on pizza stone; cook until golden on one side, about 10 minutes.</li>
              <li>Remove from pizza stone. Spread pizza sauce in an even layer onto cooked side dough, leaving 1/2-inch edge bare. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top of sauce; top with pepperoni.</li>
              <li>Place on pizza stone; tent with aluminum foil and cook until cheese has melted, about 10 minutes. Transfer pizza to a cutting board. Cool slightly before cutting and serving.</li>
